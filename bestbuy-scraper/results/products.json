          "The factory warranty is a limited one-year warranty on very basic defects and usually does not cover accidental damage or theft. \n\nYou do not have to buy Apple Care right away with your purchase, you have 60 days from the purchase date to add apple care to the device. You can do this from your device or you can go to an Apple Store and add it in store, you'll just need your device added to Find My so they can pull your serial number. You do not have to have the device with you. \n\nYou have the option of purchasing - Monthly, Yearly, or 3 Years. The 3 year option saves you around $30.  Apple Care is available to extend after the it expires but only for a limited time. \n\nI would suggest getting apple care on these larger investment devices. Just in case something happens you'll know that you won't be paying the retail price to replace it IF even at all.",
