They make everything out of sourdough and that flavor really pops through especially in the pasta. \n\nThe damn good wings are true to their name. We order them every time we're here! \n\nTheir cocktails are really nice too, I had the espresso martini on a Sunday afternoon and I would totally love to repeat that. \n\nAlso this place is massive! I've almost always been seated without a reservation. But be wary, there's a show venue close by so the place tends to get packed on show nights. \n\nBring Seattle visitors here after hitting up Pike Place, they will totally love it.",

The combination of  mozzarella, goat cheese, and almond pesto was such a delightful twist. Every bite was a perfect mix of savory and sweet.\n\nFor dinner, I had the Tellicherry Chicken & Smoked Gouda Pasta. The chicken was tender. The sourdough was amazing... all swimming in a creamy sauce that had just the right kick from the pepper. It was comfort food at its best!\n\nLocated right by Pike Place Market, Vons 1000 is definitely a must-visit in Seattle. The atmosphere was inviting, and the staff was super friendly. I can't wait to go back.",

For drinks they have a special that's suppose to be the best deal in town $8 for a martini and another cocktail I didn't recall. I was going to order but they make a point of saying no returns.  What if I don't like it. It's it suppose to be your pass to make a a crappy drink knowing we can't return it.  I ended up having a beer and then on my return an old Fashion. Both were good and I would have again.  For food I tried the Cuban sandwhich. The smoked gouda gnocchi and the  fig pizza.   The best was the pasta dish  I hands down recommended. if you can get a seat away from\nThe crazy bar area.  I do want to say during lunch the bar area was ok. At night though you can barely move and you have to go through the bar to get to the restaurant. Pizza was decent not bad but I have had better.",

The chicken was very tender, but flavorful for on trees I was completely mind blown by might help make pasta with salmon. The salmon was extremely tender and not fishy. The flavor went well, and the texture complimented the pasta. This dish is something that the chefs should definitely be proud of!!!!!\n\nAmazing spot and I will definitely come back",

I kept checking my phone periodically to see if I would get a text and never did. After 50 minutes, I walked inside and asked about the wait and they said they sent a text. I did not receive any text and I asked to verify the number they entered because I'm pretty sure they entered it incorrectly. They need to repeat back to confirm to avoid any miscommunication. Either way, there was a table available when I asked. \nThe server was nice and welcoming. We placed our order right away because we had time while we're waiting to go over the menu. Our food came out within 15 minutes, which was nice. The burger I ordered, Classic Seattle, was huge. It looked so juicy and loaded. I took a bite and it didn't disappoint. Can't go wrong with that if you're wanting a good burger. I tried the chicken pasta and it was delicious. The pasta was soft and perfect texture and the creamy sauce with the bites of chicken were amazing. The four meat pizza was a good size. It's pretty shareable for 2 to 3 people. I recommend getting it with zesty sauce. There was so much flavor with the melty cheese, meats and the dough was super soft. The three items we ordered were 5/5 .\n\nDelicious food and I highly recommend when in the area.",
