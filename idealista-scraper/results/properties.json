The average annual increase in property value is estimated to be in the range of 4% to 6%.

For example, in certain areas, prices have increased by between 30% and 40% in the last two years.\nThis trend is driven by the influx of international investors, strong demand for luxury properties and the overall development of the region, including infrastructure and tourist appeal.
