Marbella Hill Club was developed by the founder of ‘families of Marbella’; the area was selected for their private residences due to the proximity to Marbella’s centre and the tranquillity of the area, surrounded by green, peaceful nature. In general, the properties in Marbella Hill Club offer fantastic views to the coastline as well as breathtaking mountain views. Villas in the area enjoy high demand; however, properties don’t come often into the market. You can find apartments in the popular ‘Jardines Colgantes’ an apartment complex with large apartments, each with its own swimming pool and very spacious terraces with spectacular views. In recent years a few new developments have been built in the area such as Montebello, a gated community of high-quality apartments and Marbella Hill Village, which offer a selection of attractive townhouses.",
