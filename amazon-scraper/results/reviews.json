The controller is out of this world, especially the adaptive triggers, which is so immersive and don't even get me started on the haptic feedback... it has lightning fast load speeds, fast downloading, incredible controller, sleek design, and its very easy to use. I highly recommend. I also love how you can add a disc drive on after buying the digital version.",

    "text": "The Sony PS5 is, without a doubt, a game-changer in the world of gaming consoles compared to the PS4. From its sleek, futuristic design to its jaw-dropping performance, this console delivers on every front.The most impressive aspect is the blazing-fast load times, thanks to the custom SSD. Games boot up almost instantly, and navigating between apps and games is seamless. The visuals are stunning, with 4K resolution, ray tracing, and incredibly smooth frame rates that make every game feel immersive and lifelike.The DualSense controller is another standout feature. The adaptive triggers and haptic feedback add a new layer of immersion that makes gameplay more dynamic and engaging. Whether you\u2019re feeling the tension of a bowstring or the crunch of gravel under your tires, the tactile feedback is incredible.The PS5\u2019s game library is equally impressive, with a growing selection of exclusives like Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Demon\u2019s Souls that truly showcase the console\u2019s power. It\u2019s also backward compatible with most PS4 games, so I can enjoy my old favorites in enhanced quality.Overall, the Sony PS5 is an outstanding gaming console that sets a new standard for performance, graphics, and innovation. Whether you\u2019re a casual gamer or a hardcore enthusiast, this console is worth every penny. It\u2019s a must-have for anyone looking to experience the future of gaming!",

The one thing I had trouble with is connecting both consoles to the same network to transfer data.  The ps5 found my ps4 but it would not transfer.  So what I did was copy was storage was ps4 to a usb drive and inserted into the ps5. Then in ps5 I went to the area to copy usbs.  Can't remember what it was called but it was self explanatory.  Then I put the game disk in the slot, and the ps5 downloaded the update file.  Worked perfect!!  I am in love with this system.  Beautiful graphics..",

    "text": "The system was good, but not what i wanted. The PS5 graphics were good but there was not enough memory right out of the box. To play the new games I bought and wanted to play would require I uninstall them or add three hundred+ dollars to expand the memory, even then the big games had to removed from the SSD drive and saved in expanded memory then reinstalled to play them. Hours of wasted time. It will not recognize or play my collection of older games at all. The supplied disk drive made annoying noises and the supplied controller was over sensitive and made jerky moves, and it had very limited adjustments. There was no inverting the XY access even. I tried it and decided to send it back after 2 days, carefully packing it back into the original packaging, it looked unopened even. Here it is a month later I just got my credit for the PS5 and the 2 unopened games I bought at the same time because they put it into some kind of limbo. My PS3 kicks butt on this thing. I am now looking to another source to buy a XBox X now after this experience. At least they are backwards compatible. If you knew all this when you buy this console then enjoy!",
